# Limitations

### No tracking before the bot joins

Our bot can only track invites that happened after it has been added to a server. So it is not possible to know who invited someone if it happened in the past, before the bot was added.

### No tracking of instant invites

The bot cannot track invites that have a maximum of 1 use, which is how the "right clicking and inviting someone" works. To avoid that, tell your members that they should create a permanent invite code. One that doesn't expire.
